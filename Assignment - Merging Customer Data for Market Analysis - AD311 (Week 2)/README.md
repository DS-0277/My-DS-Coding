**Assignment - Merging Customer Data for Market Analysis - AD311 (Week 2)**


**1. Objective:** The task is to write a program that merges two sets of customer data, each sorted by customer ID, into a single, combined dataset also sorted by customer ID. This mimics a common scenario in data analytics where information from different databases needs to be consolidated for analysis.h Given two integer arrays, sorted in non-decreasing order based on customer ID, merge the two arrays to form a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final merged array should be stored inside the first array and elements that are set to 0 should be ignored.
