**Brief Report**

1) Steps for ESLint Configuration
First, I created a new directory ('ESLint Configuration') for the project and then run 'npm init' in the terminal to create a 'package.json' file. Second, I installed ESLint by running 'npm init @eslint/config' in the directory and followed the instruction. For the ESLint rules, I set to use 'double quote' and 'semi-colon' or there will be errors. Third, I created a JavaScript file called 'yourfile.js'. Now, the configuration is completed and I can run 'npx eslint yourfile.js' in the terminal to check if the code is encountering any defects.

Note: During the configuration process, it showed that 'eslintrc.js' was replaced by 'eslint.config.js' instead.

3) Issues Encountered
When I wrote a simple code without following the rules set above, it showed errors just showed in the screenshot attached with the project. The issues were fixed when I added semi colon and double-quote and ran the code checker again.
